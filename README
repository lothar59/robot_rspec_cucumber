ruby 1.9.3p125
cucumber 1.2.0
rspec 2.10.0 

HOW TO PLAY :

1) place the robot

Here 00N stands for 0 in x 0 in y and the robot facing North.
It corresponds to the SOUTH EAST position.
You can go up to 4. so 44N, is the opposite position.
You can use the letter 'N' 'S' 'W' 'E' to give him a direction

ex : PLACE 10S
	corresponding to 1 in x, 0 in y and facing South

2) Then you can use the command :
MOVE
LEFT
RIGHT
REPORT

defined in the attachment.txt file that you will find enclosed in this email.

Feel free to launch the scenarios with cucumber and launch the tests with rspec
You may want to use the following command for rspec : 
	rspec --color --format doc

I could have done all the tests with Test::Unit and if you like I can write them if you want.

Thank you for taking the time to read this :).

To launch it : bin/robotsimulator

Enjoy my simulator :)
